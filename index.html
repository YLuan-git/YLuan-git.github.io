    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a postdoctoral fellow in Biostatistics at Indiana University, where my research 
      focuses on developing statistical and computational methods for analyzing complex, 
      high-dimensional biomedical data. My work addresses challenges such as 
      measurement error, functional data, missingness, and the integration of wearable 
      device and nutrition data. I aim to create scalable and interpretable tools that 
      advance reproducibility, equity, and rigor in biomedical research. 
    </p>

    <h2>Mission & Values</h2>
    <p>
      What drives me as a researcher is the belief that rigorous methods are essential 
      to revealing the truth in data. My mission is to develop tools that not only 
      improve the validity of biomedical findings but also make these tools 
      accessible to the wider scientific and public health communities.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Personally, I value persistence, collaboration, and curiosity. As the first in my 
      family to pursue higher education, I understand the importance of resilience and 
      mentorship. I strive to contribute to a more equitable scientific community by 
      developing methods that address biases in data and by mentoring the next 
      generation of statisticians and data scientists.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately, I see my work as part of a broader effort to ensure that advances in 
      data science and AI/ML lead to health solutions that are fair, reproducible, and 
      impactful across diverse populations.
